# 🚀 Autonomous Intelligent Routing Engine

Where **Empathy Meets Engineering** – a fully adaptive, intelligent triage and routing system powered by conversational AI, dynamic automation, and contextual understanding.

## Overview

`autonomous-intelligent-routing` is an AI-powered helpdesk triage engine that does more than just react — it **anticipates, learns, and evolves**. Designed to transform traditional ticketing systems into responsive, intelligent, and human-centric platforms, this system uses a combination of conversational AI, intelligent search, and large language models (LLMs) to route issues with **surgical precision**.

At the core of the system lies a feedback loop that continuously absorbs new workflows, documents, and interactions to improve accuracy and performance over time.

## 📌 Workflow Overview

### 1. User Request Initiation
A user submits a question or issue through a web interface.
### 2. Trigger n8n Workflow
The request is sent to **n8n**, which orchestrates the full automation flow
### 3. Semantic Search with Qdrant
- **Ollama** generates embedding vectors from the user input.
- n8n uses these vectors to perform a similarity search in **Qdrant**.
- Qdrant returns the most relevant past requests or knowledge snippets.
### 4. If a relevant match is found
  → The matched content is used to respond to the user directly.
### 5. If a relevant match is not found
  → n8n calls **Ollama LLM** to generate a draft solution based on the request.
### 5. 📨 Ticket Creation & Storage
- A ticket is created in appropriate ticketing tool Service Now, JIRA, etc. 
- A ticket will be automatically routed based on the user's input, such as their department, the content of their request, and other contextual information. This allows the system to assign the ticket to the most appropriate team or support group, ensuring faster and more accurate resolution.
### 6. 📚 Continuous Learning
- Accurate answers from resolved requests are added to the knowledge base to improve future search and response quality.
