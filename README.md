# 🚀 Autonomous Intelligent Routing Engine

Where **Empathy Meets Engineering** – a fully adaptive, intelligent triage and routing system powered by conversational AI, dynamic automation, and contextual understanding.

## 🌟 Overview

`autonomous-intelligent-routing` is an AI-powered helpdesk triage engine that does more than just react — it **anticipates, learns, and evolves**. Designed to transform traditional ticketing systems into responsive, intelligent, and human-centric platforms, this system uses a combination of conversational AI, intelligent search, and large language models (LLMs) to route issues with **surgical precision**.

At the core of the system lies a feedback loop that continuously absorbs new workflows, documents, and interactions to improve accuracy and performance over time.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🤖 **Conversational AI** (Rasa) for natural human interaction
- 📚 **Context-aware Knowledge Search** (Haystack + Bookstack)
- 🔁 **Visual Automation & Dynamic Routing** (n8n)
- 🧠 **LLM-based Intent Interpretation & Learning**
- 🚀 **Continuous Learning & Self-Improvement**
- 🔄 **CI/CD Pipeline for Auto-Deployment**

## 🏗️ System Architecture
Embed Diagram Here

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/autonomous-intelligent-routing.git  
cd autonomous-intelligent-routing
```

## ▶️ Run the Stack
To start the entire system locally:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## 🔐 Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following variables:
```bash 
RASA_MODEL_PATH=./models
HAYSTACK_API_KEY=your_key
BOOKSTACK_DB_HOST=localhost
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
LLM_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4
```

## 🚦 Workflow Description

1. ### User Request Initiation  
   A user submits a request via chatbot (Rasa).
2. ### Intent Recognition & Routing  
   Rasa interprets the intent and sends the data to n8n.
3. ### Knowledge Check  
   Haystack queries Bookstack to locate an existing answer.
4. ### Auto-Resolve or Escalate  
   - If found → Response delivered → Ticket auto-assigned or closed.  
   - If not found → LLM generates a draft solution → Ticket is created and routed.
5. ### Learning & Feedback  
   New solutions are validated and added to Bookstack.  
   The system adapts over time based on usage patterns and resolutions.
