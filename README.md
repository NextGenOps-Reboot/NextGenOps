## Installation

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # you should update secrets and passwords inside
```

### Running n8n using Docker Compose

#### For Nvidia GPU users

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # you should update secrets and passwords inside
docker compose --profile gpu-nvidia up
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you have not used your Nvidia GPU with Docker before, please follow the
> [Ollama Docker instructions](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/docker.md).

### For AMD GPU users on Linux

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # you should update secrets and passwords inside
docker compose --profile gpu-amd up
```

#### For Mac / Apple Silicon users

If you‚Äôre using a Mac with an M1 or newer processor, you can't expose your GPU
to the Docker instance, unfortunately. There are two options in this case:

1. Run the starter kit fully on CPU, like in the section "For everyone else"
   below
2. Run Ollama on your Mac for faster inference, and connect to that from the
   n8n instance

If you want to run Ollama on your mac, check the
[Ollama homepage](https://ollama.com/)
for installation instructions, and run the starter kit as follows:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # you should update secrets and passwords inside
docker compose up
```

##### For Mac users running OLLAMA locally

If you're running OLLAMA locally on your Mac (not in Docker), you need to modify the OLLAMA_HOST environment variable

1. Set OLLAMA_HOST to `host.docker.internal:11434` in your .env file. 
2. Additionally, after you see "Editor is now accessible via: <http://localhost:5678/>":

    1. Head to <http://localhost:5678/home/credentials>
    2. Click on "Local Ollama service"
    3. Change the base URL to "http://host.docker.internal:11434/"

#### For everyone else

```bash
git clone https://github.com/n8n-io/self-hosted-ai-starter-kit.git
cd self-hosted-ai-starter-kit
cp .env.example .env # you should update secrets and passwords inside
docker compose --profile cpu up
```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start and usage

The core of the Self-hosted AI Starter Kit is a Docker Compose file, pre-configured with network and storage settings, minimizing the need for additional installations.
After completing the installation steps above, simply follow the steps below to get started.

1. Open <http://localhost:5678/> in your browser to set up n8n. You‚Äôll only
   have to do this once.
2. Open the included workflow:
   <http://localhost:5678/workflow/srOnR8PAY3u4RSwb>
3. Click the **Chat** button at the bottom of the canvas, to start running the workflow.
4. If this is the first time you‚Äôre running the workflow, you may need to wait
   until Ollama finishes downloading Llama3.2. You can inspect the docker
   console logs to check on the progress.

To open n8n at any time, visit <http://localhost:5678/> in your browser.

With your n8n instance, you‚Äôll have access to over 400 integrations and a
suite of basic and advanced AI nodes such as
[AI Agent](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.agent/),
[Text classifier](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.text-classifier/),
and [Information Extractor](https://docs.n8n.io/integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.information-extractor/)
nodes. To keep everything local, just remember to use the Ollama node for your
language model and Qdrant as your vector store.

> [!NOTE]
> This starter kit is designed to help you get started with self-hosted AI
> workflows. While it‚Äôs not fully optimized for production environments, it
> combines robust components that work well together for proof-of-concept
> projects. You can customize it to meet your specific needs

## Upgrading

* ### For Nvidia GPU setups:

## Tips & tricks

### Accessing local files

The self-hosted AI starter kit will create a shared folder (by default,
located in the same directory) which is mounted to the n8n container and
allows n8n to access files on disk. This folder within the n8n container is
located at `/data/shared` -- this is the path you‚Äôll need to use in nodes that
interact with the local filesystem.

# üöÄ Autonomous Intelligent Routing Engine

Where **Empathy Meets Engineering** ‚Äì a fully adaptive, intelligent triage and routing system powered by conversational AI, dynamic automation, and contextual understanding.

## üåü Overview

`autonomous-intelligent-routing` is an AI-powered helpdesk triage engine that does more than just react ‚Äî it **anticipates, learns, and evolves**. Designed to transform traditional ticketing systems into responsive, intelligent, and human-centric platforms, this system uses a combination of conversational AI, intelligent search, and large language models (LLMs) to route issues with **surgical precision**.

At the core of the system lies a feedback loop that continuously absorbs new workflows, documents, and interactions to improve accuracy and performance over time.

## üß† Key Features

- ü§ñ **Conversational AI** (Rasa) for natural human interaction
- üìö **Context-aware Knowledge Search** (Haystack + Bookstack)
- üîÅ **Visual Automation & Dynamic Routing** (n8n)
- üß† **LLM-based Intent Interpretation & Learning**
- üöÄ **Continuous Learning & Self-Improvement**
- üîÑ **CI/CD Pipeline for Auto-Deployment**

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
Embed Diagram Here

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NextGenOps-Reboot/autonomous-intelligent-routing.git
cd autonomous-intelligent-routing
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Stack
To start the entire system locally:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## üîê Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following variables:
```bash 
RASA_MODEL_PATH=./models
HAYSTACK_API_KEY=your_key
BOOKSTACK_DB_HOST=localhost
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
LLM_MODEL_NAME=gpt-4
```

## üö¶ Workflow Description

1. ### User Request Initiation  
   A user submits a request via chatbot (Rasa).
2. ### Intent Recognition & Routing  
   Rasa interprets the intent and sends the data to n8n.
3. ### Knowledge Check  
   Haystack queries Bookstack to locate an existing answer.
4. ### Auto-Resolve or Escalate  
   - If found ‚Üí Response delivered ‚Üí Ticket auto-assigned or closed.  
   - If not found ‚Üí LLM generates a draft solution ‚Üí Ticket is created and routed.
5. ### Learning & Feedback  
   New solutions are validated and added to Bookstack.  
   The system adapts over time based on usage patterns and resolutions.

üìÅ Directory Structure
```bash 
.
